<h1>Big Data Dashboard</h1>
The Big Data Dashboard is designed to highlight the ways that Big Data can help to put more valuable, business-focused insights into the hands of key decision makers. Specifically it shows examples of:
<ul>
<li>Real-time data feeds to enable rapid sense and response activities</li>
<li>Coupling Structured and Unstructured data to paint a more complete picture</li>
<li>Granular-level analysis and insight (e.g. individual customers/clients/students/patients)</li>
<li>Predictive and prescriptive analytics where the data analysis itself provides recommendations on the "what will happen" and the "what we should do"</li>
</ul>
