Big Data Dashboard
=
The Big Data Dashboard is designed to highlight the ways that Big Data can help to put more valuable, business-focused insights into the hands of key decision makers. Specifically it shows examples of:

* Real-time data feeds to enable rapid sense and response activities</li>
* Coupling Structured and Unstructured data to paint a more complete picture</li>
* Granular-level analysis and insight (e.g. individual customers/clients/students/patients)</li>
* Predictive and prescriptive analytics where the data analysis itself provides recommendations on the "what will happen" and the "what we should do"</li>
